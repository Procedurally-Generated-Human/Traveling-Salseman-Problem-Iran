# Traveling-Salseman-Problem-Iran
The first ever TSP solution based on the coordinations of the cities and towns in Iran, it is an exact solution to a point set of 1176 nodes.  
This is a project my classmate and I worked on for our Discrete Mathematics course.

## Finding the Solution
To create this map, the following was needed:
- a dataset containing the coordinations of all cites in Iran
- a TSP algorithm
- sufficient computing power in order to find the solution in a reasonable time
